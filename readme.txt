Adds a dropdown admin menu containing links to edit each of your pages. Must be used in conjunction with any dropdown admin menu plugin.

== Description ==

Ideal for using WordPress as a CMS, Page Management Dropdown creates a "Pages" admin menu that contains a link to edit each of your published pages. It also has menu items to write a new page, and to manage pages.

This will *only* work when used in conjunction with any dropdown admin menu plugin, such as:

* [WordPress Admin Bar](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-admin-bar/)
* [Ozh Admin Dropdown Menu](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ozh-admin-drop-down-menu/)
* [Lighter Menus](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/lighter-admin-drop-menus/)

== Installation ==

1. Upload `page-management-dropdown.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Be sure you have some other plugin activated that gives you a dropdown admin menu 
2. Activate Page Management Dropdown through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I see the "Pages" menu heading, but there's no dropdown. =

This plugin won't create the dropdown behavior itself, you need to install another admin dropdown plugin, such as:

* [WordPress Admin Bar](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-admin-bar/)
* [Ozh Admin Dropdown Menu](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ozh-admin-drop-down-menu/)
* [Lighter Menus](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/lighter-admin-drop-menus/)

== Screenshots ==
