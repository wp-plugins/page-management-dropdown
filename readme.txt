Adds a link to edit each individual page to the new Pages admin menu.

== Description ==

Ideal for using WordPress as a CMS, Page Management Dropdown expands the new *Pages* administration menu by adding a link to edit each of your individual pages.

Before Wordpress 2.7, this plugin had to be used in conjunction with another administration dropdown menu plugin. This is no longer the case.

== Screenshots ==

1. Here is an example of the expanded *Pages* admin menu with Page Management Dropdown activated. You can see that there is a menu item for each individual page.
